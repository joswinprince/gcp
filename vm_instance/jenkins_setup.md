# steps for Setup a pipeline file

> 1. Access Jenkins Dashboard.
Open your web browser and navigate to your Jenkins server's URL. Log in with your credentials to access the Jenkins dashboard.
> 3. Create a New Pipeline Job.
Click on the "New Item" link on the Jenkins dashboard.
Enter a name for your pipeline job and select "Pipeline" as the job type.
Click on the "OK" or "Save" button to create the pipeline job.
> 4. Define Pipeline Configuration.
Scroll down to the "Pipeline" section of the job configuration page.
Select "Pipeline script" from the Definition dropdown menu.
You can choose between "Pipeline script" or "Pipeline script from SCM" based on whether you want to define the pipeline directly in Jenkins or retrieve it from version control.
If you choose "Pipeline script from SCM," you'll need to specify the SCM (e.g., Git, Subversion) and provide the repository URL and credentials if required.
> 5. Write Pipeline scripts.
If you selected "Pipeline script," you'll see a text area where you can write your pipeline script directly in Jenkins.
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    environment {
        MAVEN_HOME = tool 'Maven' // Maven tool configuration in Jenkins
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Check out the source code from version control
                git 'https://github.com/username/repository.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build the Maven project
                sh "${env.MAVEN_HOME}/bin/mvn clean install"
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run unit tests
                sh "${env.MAVEN_HOME}/bin/mvn test"
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Deploy artifacts (e.g., WAR file) to a remote server
                sh 'scp target/myapp.war user@server:/path/to/deployment/directory'
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        success {
            // Send notification on success
            slackSend(channel: '#build-notifications', message: 'Pipeline passed successfully!')
        }
        failure {
            // Send notification on failure
            slackSend(channel: '#build-notifications', message: 'Pipeline failed! Check Jenkins for details.')
        }
    }
}

> 7. Save Pipeline scripts.
After writing your pipeline script, click on the "Save" button to save the pipeline configuration.
> 8. Run Pipeline.
After running the pipeline, you can view the build results, console output, and any artifacts generated by the pipeline on the job page.
Navigate to the pipeline job page and click on the build number to view detailed information about the pipeline execution.
> 9. View Pipeline Results.
By following these steps, you can set up a pipeline file in Jenkins to automate your build, test, and deployment processes.
Adjust the pipeline script according to your project requirements and configurations.
